The popularity of drone technology across the mining industry has grown significantly in recent years. There are several examples where our drones are currently being deployed across mine sites making on-site activities a lot safer and more productive.,  It is important to keep in mind that mining is a labour-intensive sector with inaccurate decisions posing considerable risk to life as well as the mine itself. The use of 3D Scanning technology addresses these risks and provides several benefits including increased output from the mines.`,

        application:
          "Our drones are used for collecting visual data particularly of difficult and volatile areas such as deep and high terrains of a mine highwalls crests and inside stopes. Further aerial data captured from blast sites reduces the risk of exposure on the ground to such dangers., Normally surveying and mapping of mineral landscapes is a time-consuming process. By employing drones and a drone pilot instead of a piloted plane a mine can save around 90% of the cost per hour and collect unlimited aerial data including fine measurements by simultaneously capturing high end orthoimages., Mine workers can be subjected to rock falls extremely humid conditions gas leaks dust explosions or floods amongst other hazards. Therefore mining companies have used drones at underground mines to monitor and inspect deep underground shafts. In addition our drones are also being employed for inspection of mining equipment which is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires a highly skilled workforce.",

          "Our drones help to map out an area and will give security teams the information they need to place their forces identify weak points where sustained surveillance could be beneficial and help familiarize their team with evacuation routes in case of disaster, A combination of our tethered drones and deployable drones help security respond to all situations quickly and efficiently. By placing tethered drones to provide consistent information from key areas security is able to keep a 360Â° view of the area. Deployable drones can then be used to investigate potential disturbances reducing the response time and keeping personnel safer, Using our drones also helps security forces get closer to intruders without alerting them. Particularly at nightdrones can pinpoint an intruder's location and follow discreetly giving security time to bring in whatever forces are deemed necessary.",

          "With so much riding on the outcome of medical tests our deployment of drones helps to smooth out the flow of samples into clinical laboratories by ensuring that specimens arrive more regularly. Our drones ability to reduce processing times is beneficial not only to lab quality but also to patient outcomes by delivering test results to physicians more quickly. Hazardous material products have to be delivered safely and according to specific hazardous materials regulations, Congestion in cities can also cause many problems to transport these products in a smooth and timely manner. Our drones can solve a lot of these problems. Due to the limited time window to move organs from donor to patient often between 4-36 hours depending on the organ type the need for ultra-fast transportation is essential. Our drones have the ability to make organ delivery faster safer and more cost-effective. The medical sector is already deploying drone technology to solve some of the problems in the industry today. In the foreseeable future our drones will be able to assume many tasks in healthcare that are performed by humans to reduce variability cost and error.",

In order to ensure the availability of the right material at the right time our drones can be deployed to deliver single items directly to the production line, Our drones offer smooth delivery of goods without the need for delivery trucks and vans which can help drastically reduce road congestion. Our drones also aid in reducing environmental pollution as they are more convenient and efficient than trucks and as a result helps reduce carbon emissions in the environment Our delivery drones can carry packages to the desired setpoint without getting affected by road traffic and on a planned optimized route. As a result customers are able to get their delivery in a much shorter period of time, Drone shipping also has several benefits for both businesses and customers. Delivery times are reduced from two to three days down to a matter of hours plus there is less chance of packages being damaged during transit and handling.",
